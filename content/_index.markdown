# PRASOON'S NOTES

## _About this blog_

I've always immensely enjoyed reading Jeremy Kun's write-ups on [Math â‹‚ Programming](https://jeremykun.com/) and [John D. Cook's blog](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/). The extent of their knowledge far surpasses mine but I find that I still enjoy the same topics and so, in this blog of sorts, I'll be writing primarily about Statistics, Number Theory, _'Machine Learning'_, Data Visualization and any other interesting bits of maths which I happen to come across. The posts will be separated by topic.

Find all [posts here](/post/).
